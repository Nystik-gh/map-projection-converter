# Map projection converter

Most softwares don't support converting map projections back to equirectangular, so this is a half-assed solution to that.

For now it only does mercator -> equirectangular but I might add more in the future.

This repo primarily exists so that if my hosting of the website goes down people can still use the scripts.
